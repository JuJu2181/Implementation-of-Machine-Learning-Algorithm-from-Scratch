# NAIVE BAYES ALGORITHM FROM SCRATCH

Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on the “Bayes Theorem”. So let’s get introduced to the Bayes Theorem first.

Bayes Theorem is used to find the probability of an event occurring given the probability of another event that has already occurred. Here B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. Here P(A) is known as prior, P(A/B) is posterior, and P(B/A) is the likelihood.
