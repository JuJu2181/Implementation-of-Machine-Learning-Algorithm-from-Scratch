As the name suggests, the Random forest is a “forest” of trees! i.e Decision Trees. A random forest is a tree-based machine learning algorithm that randomly selects specific features to build multiple decision trees. The random forest then combines the output of individual decision trees to generate the final output. Now, let’s start our today’s topic on random forest from scratch.

Decision trees involve the greedy selection to the best split point from the dataset at each step. We can use random forest for classification as well as regression problems. If the total number of column in the training dataset is denoted by p :
