A decision tree is essentially a series of if-then statements, that, when applied to a record in a data set, results in the classification of that record. Therefore, once youâ€™ve created your decision tree, you will be able to run a data set through the program and get a classification for each individual record within the data set. What this means to you, as a manufacturer of quality widgets, is that the program you create from this article will be able to predict the likelihood of each user, within a data set, purchasing your finely crafted product.

A decision tree is a type of supervised learning algorithm (having a pre-defined target variable) that is mostly used in classification problems. It works for both categorical and continuous input and output variables. In this technique, we split the population or sample into two or more homogeneous sets (or sub-populations) based on the most significant splitter/differentiator in input variables.
